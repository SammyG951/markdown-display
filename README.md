# Markdown Display  

This is a project I built that allows a user to either input a link to a raw markdown file, or allows them to upload a file from their computer. Then it will display the contents of the markdown file below on the webpage. *No CSS applied*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project I helped me learn and sharpen my skills with fetching online data, uploading files, and using DOM to update the web page.


### Purpose for this project

The inpiration for this project came to me because I wanted to be able to pull my README files from my github projects, and display them on my personal website. Now I will use some processes in this project to do so. This could also be applied in many ways. One of these examples could be for a blog or post website where you wanna upload your content using markdown format.
